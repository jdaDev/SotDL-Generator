This is a program to roll up random characters for the tabletop roleplaying game Shadow of the Demon Lord, by Schwalb Entertainment.

I am writing this for my own benefit primarily, but if others find it useful then that is perfect. Shadow of the Demon Lord is a highly lethal
game, and while creating characters doesn't take a whole lot of time, it is still nice to have a tool which allows you to create one with
with the simple click of a button.

As of now it only gives general information about your character (background, relative age, etc.), but I plan to add in stats, professions,
names, and other features as well.
